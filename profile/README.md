###### FAQ: 

1. Can people outside of Capgemini access this Organisation or its content? *No, this organisation is invite only and only those with a Capgemini email and authentication can even access the form, let alone access our content*.
2. How can I add files or edit files in my Innovation Groups repo? *If you're a member of the innovation group, you should be added to that groups team. Being part of a groups team enables write permissions in that groups repo, otherwise you only have read permissions. If you wish to add files or make changes, make sure to consult either Callum McGregor or your groups lead first.*
3. When I first requested access I was only a member of 1 Innovation Group, I'm now a member of several (or i have changed groups), how can I be added to those groups teams, to receive write permissions? *In this scenario you can either: refill out the access request form with the updated groups you're a member of, or contact Callum and request this change*.
4. I received an invitation, but it's not working, what's happening? *If you've clicked the link provided in the invitation sent to your email and it hasn't worked, first, check if you received the invitation **>7 days ago**. The invitation links are only valid for 7 days. If your invite has expired, refill out the invitation request form, or contact Callum. If the link isn't working and you received it <7 days ago, contact Callum for assistance*.
